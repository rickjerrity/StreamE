## More information

Written in my spare time to solve a personal problem of watching and switching between streamers on different platforms. Open to suggestions, comments and pull requests, within reason.

I purposely chose *not* to write this in React/Vue/jQuery/etc., both to keep the page as light as possible and as a refresher for vanilla JS DOM manipulation. Also first time using CSS Grid in combination with media-queries.

I'm also not using `let` or template literals in an attempt to preserve browser compatibility (if this is an outdated or misinformed practice, please let me know)
